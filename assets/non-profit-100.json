Since its founding, the Community Action approach has emphasized local priorities, local partnerships, and maximum feasible participation—which is a requirement that individuals from communities-served be represented in the decision-making body of the agency.

Now in its 59th season, the SPCO has recently undergone transformational change with the opening of its new home, the Ordway Concert Hall, the addition of a new generation of players, and significant changes in its artistic vision. Renowned for its artistic excellence and remarkable versatility of musical styles, the SPCO is also recognized for its innovative approach to artistic leadership and commitment to accessibility. \n                                           \nThe SPCO is primarily an unconducted ensemble of virtuoso musicians that works in close collaboration with a diverse series of artistic partners – Jonathan Cohen, Jeremy Denk, Martin Fröst, Patricia Kopatchinskaja and Pekka Kuusisto – to present more than 130 concerts and educational programs each year. The orchestra reaches more than 250,000 listeners annually through its free online Concert Library and has recently begun offering both live and on-demand videos of concerts that can be viewed anytime, anywhere, on any device, completely free of charge. The SPCO has released 67 recordings, commissioned 148 new works, and has earned the distinction of 17 American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) awards for adventurous programming. The SPCO has toured nationally and internationally, including recent engagements in Europe, Asia and New York City.  \n\nThe SPCO is nationally recognized for its commitment to broad community accessibility and innovative audience outreach. The SPCO’s regular subscription series are performed in downtown Saint Paul at Ordway Center for the Performing Arts and 15 additional venues across the Twin Cities metropolitan area each season, a unique commitment to geographic accessibility for a major orchestra. The SPCO offers the most affordable tickets of any major orchestra in the United States: 50% of SPCO tickets are available for $15 or less, and the orchestra’s innovative ticket membership model allows members to pay just $7 per month to attend unlimited concerts. The SPCO has recently expanded accessibility even further by offering free tickets for children and students as a part of the New Generation Initiative. \n\nThe SPCO’s award-winning CONNECT education program reaches over 5,000 students and teachers annually in 12 Minneapolis and Saint Paul public schools, and its Target® Free Family Music program provides engaging and educational experiences for thousands of Twin Cities children and families each year. The SPCO’s Liquid Music Series (named “Best of Classical” by The New York Times) develops innovative new projects with iconoclastic artists in unique presentation formats and invites adventurous audiences to discover the new and the fascinating within the flourishing landscape of contemporary chamber music.","shortDesc":"To present a world-class professional chamber orchestra in the Twin
