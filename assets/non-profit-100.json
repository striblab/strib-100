More than 100 Salvation Army centers of operation in the division provide service in housing, youth enrichment, hunger abatement, counseling, rehabilitation and disaster relief.  Where there is no physical Salvation Army building there are volunteers making sure services are available in every county.  The Salvation Army is dedicated to reaching out to people in crisis with the love of Jesus Christ, always serving without discrimination.\n\nThe Twin Cities Salvation Army is a team of hundreds of employees and thousands of volunteers dedicated to Doing the Most Good. We provide food for the hungry, shelter for the homeless, rehabilitation for those in the grip of addiction, and so much more. The officers (ordained ministers), licensed social workers and business professionals who work for The Salvation Army believe in our mission of spreading the love of Jesus Christ without discrimination. Our six service areas include:\n\n\tBasic Needs\nThe Salvation Army saves people struggling to survive by providing food, clothing, temporary shelter and assistance with rent, utilities and transportation.\n\n\tYouth Services\nIn many inner-city neighborhoods, The Salvation Army can be a child’s only source of good. We offer after-school and summer programs, sports, music, daycare, Bible study and other vital activities.\n\tDisaster Services\nWhen tornadoes, floods and other calamities hit, survivors rely on The Salvation Army for food, hydration, spiritual support and long-term case management.\n\n\tHousing\nThe Salvation Army provides shelter to youth and adults needing housing for one night, one week, one year – even a decade. Most programs offer on-site case management to promote self-sufficiency.\n\n\tRehabilitation\nOur long- and short-term rehabilitation programs offer counseling, spiritual training and personalized support. Most are free programs funded by thrift store sales and kettle donations.\n\n\tCounseling\nThe Salvation Army provides counseling services to people with varying degrees of need. We offer quality counseling at prisons and assisted living facilities, and at our rehabilitation centers, housing facilities, and Worship and Service Centers.","shortDesc":"As a leader in faith –based human services, The Salvation Army is dedicated to reaching out to people in crisis with the love of Jesus Christ, always serving without discrimination.","history":null,"founded":null,"footnotes":null,"employees":{"id":5792,"total":784,"added":"2017-12-04T06:00:00.000Z","publishYear":2017},"finances":{"id":4575,"added":"2017-12-04T06:00:00.000Z","publishYear":2017,"fiscalYearEnd":"2016-09-30T05:00:00.000Z","annualReportDate":"2016-09-30T05:00:00.000Z","source":"Consolidated financial statement","contribGrants":56072400,"revenue":71782100,"expenses":71431300,"excess":350823,"programServiceRevenue":11220100,"footnotes":null},"prevFinances":{"id":null,"added":null,"publishYear":null,"fiscalYearEnd":null,"annualReportDate":null,"source":null,"contribGrants":null,"revenue":null,"expenses":null,"excess":null,"programServiceRevenue":null,"footnotes":null},"officer":{"id":6304,"dropped":0,"first":"Lonneal","middle":null,"last":"Richardson","lineage":null,"title":"Lt.
